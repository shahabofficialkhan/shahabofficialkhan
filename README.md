## About Me
I’m a BS(SE) student at **COMSATS University, Lahore** (CUI’29). I lead **Project Aura**, a collaborative student product development effort (10-member team) focused on building real features and documenting professional workflows. I enjoy building cross-platform apps with **Flutter**, automations with **Zapier**, and practical AI/LLM integrations using prompt engineering. I write clear code, documented READMEs, and maintain proof-of-work for internships and interviews.
