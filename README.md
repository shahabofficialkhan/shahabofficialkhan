## About Me
I’m a BS(SE) student at **COMSATS University, Lahore** (CUI’29). I lead **Project Aura**, a collaborative student product development effort (10-member team) focused on building real features and documenting professional workflows. I enjoy building cross-platform apps with **Flutter**, automations with **Zapier**, and practical AI/LLM integrations using prompt engineering. I write clear code, documented READMEs, and maintain proof-of-work for internships and interviews.

## Skills
- **Languages:** C++, Python, Dart (Flutter)
- **Frameworks / Tools:** Flutter (iOS & Web), Git, GitHub, Zapier, basic ML/AI workflows
- **Practices:** OOP, struct & pointer-oriented C++ refactor, prompt engineering, project documentation, CI basics
- **Soft:** Team leadership, project planning, technical documentation, mentoring

## Selected Projects
### Project Aura — Phase 1 (Team Lead)
- Led a 10-member student team for a 28-day OOP sprint.
- Focus: product design, sprint planning, weekly progress dashboards, and delivering MVP features.
- Responsibilities: planning, code reviews, documentation, and presentation materials.

### Train Seat Reservation System (C++ Lab)
- Converted a 2D array implementation to a `struct`/pointer-based design for better modularity and maintainability.
- Focus on robustness, edge-case handling, and documentation.

### Flutter iOS/Web App (Personal)
- Built an app skeleton with an **AI-powered popup assistant** (design + integration plan).
- Focus: user experience, modular UI components, and ChatGPT/LLM integration concept.
